# A simple to-do app
## Core functionality
we need to have distinct 'to-do' *items* that can be:
- created, edited and removed
they can be in two states:
- *uncomplete* or *complete*


## Plan
- The item can be generated,but we need to give users the option to add their own text for the item.
- There should be some sort of popup that allows the user to type what they want the item to state.
- try: a text field pops up with a button that sends whatever is in the text field to the spawnItem function

### Currently:
We can create list items but they can't be customised.
UX:
Click the "create item here button"
A text field will appear with a submit button. Once the field has the text the user wants, they press submit.
Once submit has been toggled, the text will appear as a list item. 
This may be repeated.
