# A simple to-do app
## Core functionality
we need to have distinct 'to-do' *items* that can be:
- created, edited and removed
they can be in two states:
- *uncomplete* or *complete*

## Current abilities
- [x] Users can create todo items, but they will not persist after exiting the app
- [x] The todo submit form 'drops down' and hides after submitting the item
- [x] The user may resize the app window and the dimensions *will* persist after exit
